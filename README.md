# Ski_Scraping_Case
Repository from DataBird's Freeglisse Scraping case.

In this project we had to scrap a website to gather informations about second hand market for ski equipments.
Once we identified which elements where scrapable, we prepared the code present in the Jupyter notebook to output a csv.

We then imported the csv into Google sheet and linked it to Data Studio in order to work with the dataviz part of the project.
